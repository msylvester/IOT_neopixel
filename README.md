Synopsis

This repository has the code to create an webserver (agent.nut) that can program a neopixel light to behave in many ways.  The code running the Electic IMP attached to the neoxpixel is in (device.nut).

Note, I bought all the hardware for this product including the April Development Board (IMP), Breadboard, and neopixel. \

Motivation

I wanted to play around with building an IOT device from scratch. 

Notes
Agent.nut and Device.nut are written in Squirrel.
